Revision history for Catalyst-DispatchType-Regex

5.90030 - Wed Apr 10 10:04:59 EDT 2013
    Initial release of standalone Catalyst-DispatchType-Regex

    The Regex dispatch types have been depreciated and removed from
    Catalyst core. This distribution is being made available as a
    fallback for developers who need the Regex dispatch type until
    they can convert to Chaind methods or other alternative.

    This distribution creates a separate DispatchType for each of
    Regex, Regexp, LocalRegex, and LocalRegexp. Previously C::Dispatcher
    converted all of these to Regex before passing it off to that
    one dispatch type.

    Dispatch order is no longer guaranteed to be Regex before LocalRegex.
    It now depends on when the DispatchType is seen in a controller.
