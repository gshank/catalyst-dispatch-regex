    Initial release of standalone Catalyst-DispatchType-Regex

    The Regex dispatch types have been depreciated and removed from
    Catalyst core. This distribution is being made available as a
    fallback for developers who need the Regex dispatch type until
    they can convert to Chaind methods or other alternative.

    This distribution creates a separate DispatchType for each of
    Regex, Regexp, LocalRegex, and LocalRegexp. Previously C::Dispatcher
    converted all of these to Regex before passing it off to that
    one dispatch type.

    ** Dispatch order is no longer guaranteed to be Regex before LocalRegex
    (was it ever?). It now depends on when the DispatchType is seen in a
    controller.
